# ember-material
### Wrapper components for google's [web starter kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/) material design elements. 

**Note:** expect periodic breaking changes since we're following the development of the material-sprint branch of wsk.

____

This is an ember-cli addon containing a collection of [ember js](http://emberjs.com/) 
components wrapping/adapting the vanilla javascript that powers the material 
design elements included in the future release of Google's 
[Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/).

The aim if this project is to keep some compatibility with the default WSK,
if you need something that replaces the javascript with more native ember
code check [ember-paper](https://github.com/miguelcobain/ember-paper).
